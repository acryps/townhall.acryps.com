i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Ferrowfield", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #10 in size, #29 closest to center, #29 in population, #29 in population density, #2 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Leonshowe: Leonshowe, a central district in the City of Pilegron, holds historical significance as it originated from the Duke of Leon's house built on its mountainous terrain. It later became home to the Metro factory and early systematic housing. The district features an incomplete station and is marked for the Science City University expansion, though only a single university building exists so far. Despite its central location, much of Leonshowe remains underdeveloped, with significant land owned by the university or the Duke of Leonshowe.,
- Portbryn: Portbryn is a district known for its abundance of student housing, situated on a hill. It features a notable and undisrupted post station, and many university buildings. The area is served by a railway station on the university railway. Its name is derived from Port Prince Square, a historically significant site with an ancient, now inactive, portal to another dimension.,
- Brunock: Brunock is a largely undeveloped borough located adjacent to a significant mountain. It is strategically positioned next to the administrative district and the university, providing housing for some students. The area once featured a railway line, now abandoned, but is connected to the industrial center and new developments in the east by a major street.,
- Astokeshire: Astokeshire is the primary estate of the Duke of Astokeshire, a significant landowner in the region. The Duke's large manor is situated on a mountain within Astokeshire, which is currently entirely forested. The district lacks any residential buildings but features a train bridge connecting it to Sheenford.,
- Kittenhill: Kittenhill is an industrial district, once home to a hill filled with children and kittens, but now transformed to accommodate the Mekle Iron Company's iron farm. It features numerous railways leading out of Union Station, passing through the area. Key industries in Kittenhill include sheep herding and wool production, a shear manufacturing business, and a bed-making company. The district also hosts the Railway Labs Company with a testing ring for new railway equipment, although recent developments have seen the public railways acquire this company, with no inventions having been released yet.,
- Rochester: Rochester, once a military district, has transformed into a prosperous borough characterized by extensive worker housing. It pioneered a housing system that enabled the rapid construction of affordable homes with decent living standards, attracting a significant influx of workers. This growth has been capitalized on through the development of a metro line connecting Rochester to nearby industrial zones, further boosting its wealth. Though the district continues to expand, some of the land remains undeveloped, with the foundational grid already in place. Rochester retains its military heritage with training grounds and a shooting range still active. Lush parks and broad, tree-lined roads enhance the living environment, while the historically significant Rochester Bridge has been replaced by a charming pedestrian walkway.
