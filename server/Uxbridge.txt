i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Uxbridge", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #26 in size, #15 closest to center, #46 in population, #46 in population density, #45 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Ealing: Ealing is a centrally located, small district in the City of Pilegron, situated just outside the western city border. It features numerous small houses, a park, and some of the city's oldest homes that have been relocated here for preservation. Ealing is positioned along one of the main streets and boasts excellent connectivity with the tube.,
- Tower Hamlets: Tower Hamlets is a district situated just outside the central area of the City of Pilegron. It is characterized by its early industrial factories and residential buildings, including the city's oldest railway factory. The district neighbors two small areas known as Anchor and contains significant historic sites such as Mayfair, a notable restaurant where the city's expansion plans were made, and Manor House, once the residence of a duke.,
- Blakefield: Blakefield, once a swampy area, has recently been transformed to accommodate settlements, industry, and a large railway yard. The area was previously traversed by a railway bridge known as Uxbridge. Currently, Blakefield boasts a significant amount of undeveloped land, indicating potential for industrial growth. Its location is somewhat secluded, as it is situated within a valley.,
- Welatunelton: Welatunelton is an artistic district known for its historical transformation from once swampy lands to a hub of industry. It primarily houses railway yards, service workshops, and factories of the Metro company. An intriguing historical fact about Welatunelton is that it once featured a tunnel used to bring in foreign workers from outside the city. The district is undergoing rapid changes, suggesting a shift in its character and possibly its role within the City of Pilegron.,
- Edminton: Edminton is an industrial hub in the City of Pilegron. It features both a station and a tube station, serving as key transport links for its numerous factories. The borough is notably home to the infamous Rochester House.,
- Leonshowe: Leonshowe, a central district in the City of Pilegron, holds historical significance as it originated from the Duke of Leon's house built on its mountainous terrain. It later became home to the Metro factory and early systematic housing. The district features an incomplete station and is marked for the Science City University expansion, though only a single university building exists so far. Despite its central location, much of Leonshowe remains underdeveloped, with significant land owned by the university or the Duke of Leonshowe.,
- Westminster: Westminster, a borough in the City of Pilegron, hosts the city's main church and lies next to the central Metier Street. It is noteworthy for its proximity to a park and the old city walls. Though sparsely populated on Spruce Street, it is famous for its historic shooting range where military officers and sport shooters have trained. Leon Street, a major thoroughfare, connects to Leonshowe from here. Westminster Train Station, developed under the "Each Borough Station Act", provides key transport links within the city.
