i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Portbryn", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #29 in size, #23 closest to center, #30 in population, #28 in population density, #11 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Ferrowfield: Ferrowfield is a crucial industrial hub in the City of Pilegron. Originally open plains known as Faoro Field, it transformed with the industrial movement building significant iron plants. The district was designed as a collaborative industrial zone, fostering shared resources among various industries. Ferrowfield houses the pivotal Union Station, born from a major freight station, which serves multiple railway companies and has become the heart of the public railway system. The cityâ€™s administrative activities are concentrated here, with key centers like Law House. Recently, Ferrowfield has expanded rapidly, becoming increasingly compact. Although Union Station is a vital city hub, it now primarily serves private railway companies.,
- Brunock: Brunock is a largely undeveloped borough located adjacent to a significant mountain. It is strategically positioned next to the administrative district and the university, providing housing for some students. The area once featured a railway line, now abandoned, but is connected to the industrial center and new developments in the east by a major street.,
- Enfield: Enfield, once an open field, now hosts significant urban development, including a prestigious university shared with Bexley. It features a large, well-known train station and the notable Rawie complex, which operates as a self-governed district.,
- Bexley: Bexley is the university district of the City of Pilegron, situated just outside the city wall. Dominated by academic influence, it hosts two of the four main university buildings along with student housing. Renowned and prestigious, Bexley's university has been pivotal in driving recent progress in the city.,
- Origin: Origin is a historic district situated on a mountain that remains a park today, symbolizing where the City of Pilegron began. It features the Origin Tower, a former military structure that once safeguarded the city. The district also hosts essential buildings for newcomers and is home to the Origin Main Station, the city's central railway hub.,
- Leonshowe: Leonshowe, a central district in the City of Pilegron, holds historical significance as it originated from the Duke of Leon's house built on its mountainous terrain. It later became home to the Metro factory and early systematic housing. The district features an incomplete station and is marked for the Science City University expansion, though only a single university building exists so far. Despite its central location, much of Leonshowe remains underdeveloped, with significant land owned by the university or the Duke of Leonshowe.
