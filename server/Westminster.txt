i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Westminster", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #43 in size, #2 closest to center, #32 in population, #31 in population density, #15 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- City of Pilegron: The City of Pilegron's central borough is the heart of administration and home to prominent companies. Originating from a few houses along Main Street, it centers around Metier Hall, where congress meets. Metier Street, another key area, extends from Metier Hall. Despite the borough's central importance, the northern end remains undeveloped with no future plans. Residential presence is minimal, with historic buildings on Pachino and Halifax Street housing the few residents, as most buildings are occupied by company offices.,
- Ealing: Ealing is a centrally located, small district in the City of Pilegron, situated just outside the western city border. It features numerous small houses, a park, and some of the city's oldest homes that have been relocated here for preservation. Ealing is positioned along one of the main streets and boasts excellent connectivity with the tube.,
- Uxbridge: Uxbridge is a district characterized by its historic brick bridge, a significant landmark that initially influenced its formation. The eastern side of the Pilger River is densely populated with small houses, largely controlled by Lloyds Investment Bank, which is currently restricting further development. In contrast, the western part remains mostly undeveloped, making it an intriguing area for future construction opportunities.,
- Leonshowe: Leonshowe, a central district in the City of Pilegron, holds historical significance as it originated from the Duke of Leon's house built on its mountainous terrain. It later became home to the Metro factory and early systematic housing. The district features an incomplete station and is marked for the Science City University expansion, though only a single university building exists so far. Despite its central location, much of Leonshowe remains underdeveloped, with significant land owned by the university or the Duke of Leonshowe.
