i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Blakefield", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #12 in size, #30 closest to center, #5 in population, #18 in population density, #23 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Welatunelton: Welatunelton is an artistic district known for its historical transformation from once swampy lands to a hub of industry. It primarily houses railway yards, service workshops, and factories of the Metro company. An intriguing historical fact about Welatunelton is that it once featured a tunnel used to bring in foreign workers from outside the city. The district is undergoing rapid changes, suggesting a shift in its character and possibly its role within the City of Pilegron.,
- Uxbridge: Uxbridge is a district characterized by its historic brick bridge, a significant landmark that initially influenced its formation. The eastern side of the Pilger River is densely populated with small houses, largely controlled by Lloyds Investment Bank, which is currently restricting further development. In contrast, the western part remains mostly undeveloped, making it an intriguing area for future construction opportunities.,
- Tower Hamlets: Tower Hamlets is a district situated just outside the central area of the City of Pilegron. It is characterized by its early industrial factories and residential buildings, including the city's oldest railway factory. The district neighbors two small areas known as Anchor and contains significant historic sites such as Mayfair, a notable restaurant where the city's expansion plans were made, and Manor House, once the residence of a duke.,
- Anker: Anker is a borough located just outside the city walls of the City of Pilegron. It was initially developed to accommodate a small port on the Pilger River. While it features a mix of housing and small industries, it remains unconnected to the train network. Anker is notable for having some of the city's oldest, now-defunct factories, which were once instrumental in producing segments for the underground railway. The borough is also home to one of the wealthiest residents of Pilegron, Mr. O'brookes.
