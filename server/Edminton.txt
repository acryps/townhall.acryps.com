i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Edminton", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #21 in size, #24 closest to center, #40 in population, #40 in population density, #17 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Uxbridge: Uxbridge is a district characterized by its historic brick bridge, a significant landmark that initially influenced its formation. The eastern side of the Pilger River is densely populated with small houses, largely controlled by Lloyds Investment Bank, which is currently restricting further development. In contrast, the western part remains mostly undeveloped, making it an intriguing area for future construction opportunities.,
- Welatunelton: Welatunelton is an artistic district known for its historical transformation from once swampy lands to a hub of industry. It primarily houses railway yards, service workshops, and factories of the Metro company. An intriguing historical fact about Welatunelton is that it once featured a tunnel used to bring in foreign workers from outside the city. The district is undergoing rapid changes, suggesting a shift in its character and possibly its role within the City of Pilegron.,
- Rochester: Rochester, once a military district, has transformed into a prosperous borough characterized by extensive worker housing. It pioneered a housing system that enabled the rapid construction of affordable homes with decent living standards, attracting a significant influx of workers. This growth has been capitalized on through the development of a metro line connecting Rochester to nearby industrial zones, further boosting its wealth. Though the district continues to expand, some of the land remains undeveloped, with the foundational grid already in place. Rochester retains its military heritage with training grounds and a shooting range still active. Lush parks and broad, tree-lined roads enhance the living environment, while the historically significant Rochester Bridge has been replaced by a charming pedestrian walkway.,
- Leonshowe: Leonshowe, a central district in the City of Pilegron, holds historical significance as it originated from the Duke of Leon's house built on its mountainous terrain. It later became home to the Metro factory and early systematic housing. The district features an incomplete station and is marked for the Science City University expansion, though only a single university building exists so far. Despite its central location, much of Leonshowe remains underdeveloped, with significant land owned by the university or the Duke of Leonshowe.
