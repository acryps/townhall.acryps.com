i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Danue", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #40 in size, #4 closest to center, #24 in population, #17 in population density, #26 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- City of Pilegron: The City of Pilegron's central borough is the heart of administration and home to prominent companies. Originating from a few houses along Main Street, it centers around Metier Hall, where congress meets. Metier Street, another key area, extends from Metier Hall. Despite the borough's central importance, the northern end remains undeveloped with no future plans. Residential presence is minimal, with historic buildings on Pachino and Halifax Street housing the few residents, as most buildings are occupied by company offices.,
- New Republic: New Republic is a central district located just north of the city proper in the City of Pilegron. Historically, it was home to the Congress building, which has since been demolished. The district's name, New Republic, reflects its transformation into a socially oriented housing area following the demolition. Despite its central location, it is one of the poorest neighborhoods due to the deterioration of its social housing over the years. The area is densely built, featuring dirt roads, and is notably marked by Congress Gate, a remnant of the old Congress building. The few available plots have been acquired by an investment company.,
- Hammer: Hammer, once primarily a workers' district, has undergone significant transformation. It now hosts the headquarters of several banks and the public market, a central hub for stock trading and business transactions. The area remains densely packed with small houses, retaining its historical character, and is situated near the Pilger River, maintaining its strategic importance.,
- Loirent: Loirent is a central district in the City of Pilegron, located just outside the city walls and neighboring Danue. It features charming, small, and old houses, embodying a quaint atmosphere. The district also includes a public bath and is positioned near the central main station, making it easily accessible.,
- Origin: Origin is a historic district situated on a mountain that remains a park today, symbolizing where the City of Pilegron began. It features the Origin Tower, a former military structure that once safeguarded the city. The district also hosts essential buildings for newcomers and is home to the Origin Main Station, the city's central railway hub.
