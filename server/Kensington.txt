i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Kensington", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #38 in size, #3 closest to center, #21 in population, #16 in population density, #13 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Ealing: Ealing is a centrally located, small district in the City of Pilegron, situated just outside the western city border. It features numerous small houses, a park, and some of the city's oldest homes that have been relocated here for preservation. Ealing is positioned along one of the main streets and boasts excellent connectivity with the tube.,
- Tower Hamlets: Tower Hamlets is a district situated just outside the central area of the City of Pilegron. It is characterized by its early industrial factories and residential buildings, including the city's oldest railway factory. The district neighbors two small areas known as Anchor and contains significant historic sites such as Mayfair, a notable restaurant where the city's expansion plans were made, and Manor House, once the residence of a duke.,
- Anker: Anker is a borough located just outside the city walls of the City of Pilegron. It was initially developed to accommodate a small port on the Pilger River. While it features a mix of housing and small industries, it remains unconnected to the train network. Anker is notable for having some of the city's oldest, now-defunct factories, which were once instrumental in producing segments for the underground railway. The borough is also home to one of the wealthiest residents of Pilegron, Mr. O'brookes.,
- Hamstad: Hamstad is a small district known for its single historic defensive building, which remains as its primary feature. Once used for defense, this building now serves as a historical site, with no other developments or structures present in the area.,
- Camden: Camden is the historical heart of the City of Pilegron, situated along the Pilger River. Known for its preserved historic charm, it features the notable Church of Camden upon the river. Unlike other inner boroughs, it remains largely unchanged, housing mainly residents who cherish its traditional character. The community's strong opposition to change has posed challenges for infrastructure development, such as introducing a Metro Station.,
- Blacksmith: Blacksmith is a historic district in the City of Pilegron, located just north of the city center along the Pilger River. Once home to numerous blacksmiths, it has transformed into a culinary hub, hosting some of the city's most important and renowned restaurants. Despite its small size, Blacksmith retains its historical charm while embracing modernity.,
- City of Pilegron: The City of Pilegron's central borough is the heart of administration and home to prominent companies. Originating from a few houses along Main Street, it centers around Metier Hall, where congress meets. Metier Street, another key area, extends from Metier Hall. Despite the borough's central importance, the northern end remains undeveloped with no future plans. Residential presence is minimal, with historic buildings on Pachino and Halifax Street housing the few residents, as most buildings are occupied by company offices.
