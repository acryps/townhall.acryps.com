i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Ealing", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #39 in size, #9 closest to center, #19 in population, #15 in population density, #24 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Tower Hamlets: Tower Hamlets is a district situated just outside the central area of the City of Pilegron. It is characterized by its early industrial factories and residential buildings, including the city's oldest railway factory. The district neighbors two small areas known as Anchor and contains significant historic sites such as Mayfair, a notable restaurant where the city's expansion plans were made, and Manor House, once the residence of a duke.,
- Uxbridge: Uxbridge is a district characterized by its historic brick bridge, a significant landmark that initially influenced its formation. The eastern side of the Pilger River is densely populated with small houses, largely controlled by Lloyds Investment Bank, which is currently restricting further development. In contrast, the western part remains mostly undeveloped, making it an intriguing area for future construction opportunities.,
- Westminster: Westminster, a borough in the City of Pilegron, hosts the city's main church and lies next to the central Metier Street. It is noteworthy for its proximity to a park and the old city walls. Though sparsely populated on Spruce Street, it is famous for its historic shooting range where military officers and sport shooters have trained. Leon Street, a major thoroughfare, connects to Leonshowe from here. Westminster Train Station, developed under the "Each Borough Station Act", provides key transport links within the city.,
- City of Pilegron: The City of Pilegron's central borough is the heart of administration and home to prominent companies. Originating from a few houses along Main Street, it centers around Metier Hall, where congress meets. Metier Street, another key area, extends from Metier Hall. Despite the borough's central importance, the northern end remains undeveloped with no future plans. Residential presence is minimal, with historic buildings on Pachino and Halifax Street housing the few residents, as most buildings are occupied by company offices.,
- Kensington: Kensington is a posh borough located in the city center, primarily inhabited by conservative and wealthy residents. It is known for its traditional, well-paying professions such as judges and doctors rather than for innovation. Originally home to sheep farms, it now features lavish houses inside and outside the old city walls. The Ealing Tower, a remnant of the fortifications, partially stands in Kensington. A notable feature is its rare and ancient disposal line, a relic of Pilegron's first inhabitants. The main thoroughfare is Kensington Lane, branching from Main Street. There are no metro or train stations, as the residents opposed their construction.
