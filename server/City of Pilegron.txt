also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Ealing: Ealing is a centrally located, small district in the City of Pilegron, situated just outside the western city border. It features numerous small houses, a park, and some of the city's oldest homes that have been relocated here for preservation. Ealing is positioned along one of the main streets and boasts excellent connectivity with the tube.,
- Kensington: Kensington is a posh borough located in the city center, primarily inhabited by conservative and wealthy residents. It is known for its traditional, well-paying professions such as judges and doctors rather than for innovation. Originally home to sheep farms, it now features lavish houses inside and outside the old city walls. The Ealing Tower, a remnant of the fortifications, partially stands in Kensington. A notable feature is its rare and ancient disposal line, a relic of Pilegron's first inhabitants. The main thoroughfare is Kensington Lane, branching from Main Street. There are no metro or train stations, as the residents opposed their construction.,
- Blacksmith: Blacksmith is a historic district in the City of Pilegron, located just north of the city center along the Pilger River. Once home to numerous blacksmiths, it has transformed into a culinary hub, hosting some of the city's most important and renowned restaurants. Despite its small size, Blacksmith retains its historical charm while embracing modernity.,
- New Republic: New Republic is a central district located just north of the city proper in the City of Pilegron. Historically, it was home to the Congress building, which has since been demolished. The district's name, New Republic, reflects its transformation into a socially oriented housing area following the demolition. Despite its central location, it is one of the poorest neighborhoods due to the deterioration of its social housing over the years. The area is densely built, featuring dirt roads, and is notably marked by Congress Gate, a remnant of the old Congress building. The few available plots have been acquired by an investment company.,
- Danue: Danue is a central borough located just outside the eastern city walls of the City of Pilegron. It is renowned for its historic houses and the charming Danue Market. The borough also features a central railway station with its square within Danue's boundaries.,
- Origin: Origin is a historic district situated on a mountain that remains a park today, symbolizing where the City of Pilegron began. It features the Origin Tower, a former military structure that once safeguarded the city. The district also hosts essential buildings for newcomers and is home to the Origin Main Station, the city's central railway hub.,
- Leonshowe: Leonshowe, a central district in the City of Pilegron, holds historical significance as it originated from the Duke of Leon's house built on its mountainous terrain. It later became home to the Metro factory and early systematic housing. The district features an incomplete station and is marked for the Science City University expansion, though only a single university building exists so far. Despite its central location, much of Leonshowe remains underdeveloped, with significant land owned by the university or the Duke of Leonshowe.,
- Westminster: Westminster, a borough in the City of Pilegron, hosts the city's main church and lies next to the central Metier Street. It is noteworthy for its proximity to a park and the old city walls. Though sparsely populated on Spruce Street, it is famous for its historic shooting range where military officers and sport shooters have trained. Leon Street, a major thoroughfare, connects to Leonshowe from here. Westminster Train Station, developed under the "Each Borough Station Act", provides key transport links within the city.
