i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Pilebrook", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #3 in size, #46 closest to center, #26 in population, #32 in population density, #43 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Rochester: Rochester, once a military district, has transformed into a prosperous borough characterized by extensive worker housing. It pioneered a housing system that enabled the rapid construction of affordable homes with decent living standards, attracting a significant influx of workers. This growth has been capitalized on through the development of a metro line connecting Rochester to nearby industrial zones, further boosting its wealth. Though the district continues to expand, some of the land remains undeveloped, with the foundational grid already in place. Rochester retains its military heritage with training grounds and a shooting range still active. Lush parks and broad, tree-lined roads enhance the living environment, while the historically significant Rochester Bridge has been replaced by a charming pedestrian walkway.,
- Kittenhill: Kittenhill is an industrial district, once home to a hill filled with children and kittens, but now transformed to accommodate the Mekle Iron Company's iron farm. It features numerous railways leading out of Union Station, passing through the area. Key industries in Kittenhill include sheep herding and wool production, a shear manufacturing business, and a bed-making company. The district also hosts the Railway Labs Company with a testing ring for new railway equipment, although recent developments have seen the public railways acquire this company, with no inventions having been released yet.,
- Astoke Mountain: Astoke Mountain was originally owned by the Duke of Astokeshire, who has a residence on a nearby mountain. Ownership of Astoke Mountain has been transferred to the City of Pilegron in exchange for other land in Astokeshire. Currently, there are no inhabitants on Astoke Mountain, but two state railway tunnels run through it.,
- Astokeshire: Astokeshire is the primary estate of the Duke of Astokeshire, a significant landowner in the region. The Duke's large manor is situated on a mountain within Astokeshire, which is currently entirely forested. The district lacks any residential buildings but features a train bridge connecting it to Sheenford.
