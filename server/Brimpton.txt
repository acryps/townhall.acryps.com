i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Brimpton", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #8 in size, #40 closest to center, #3 in population, #9 in population density, #37 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Creston: Creston is a flat district in the City of Pilegron, notable for housing a stadium and a railway station that provides connectivity to it. The area is rural in nature, with only two farmhouses dotting the landscape.,
- Harrow: Harrow is an industrial district in the City of Pilegron, characterized by its significant factory presence and recent developments in the metro system. It has undergone substantial change with the introduction of the new Harrow Hill railway station, replacing much of the old industrial yard area. Though primarily industrial, it includes some residential housing. Situated on the city's main road, Harrow is appealing for property development. Historically, it housed some of the city's earliest residences, although only two remain after the recent accidental destruction of one.,
- Harrow Hill: Harrow Hill is home to the prominent new central railway station of a private railway company. The area's transformation involved flattening the hill using challenging excavation techniques. Currently, Harrow Hill comprises primarily the railway station, a graveyard, and part of the Duke of Yorkshire's estate. Its strategic location on the city's main road influenced the railway company's decision to establish their station here.,
- Bellingville: Bellingville, once an old village, derives its name from a legendary spell that was lost as the city expanded and absorbed surrounding areas. Today, Bellingville features a blend of history with its old houses and a notable roundabout, reflecting its evolution over time.
