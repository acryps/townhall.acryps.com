i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Tower Hamlets", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #30 in size, #14 closest to center, #12 in population, #12 in population density, #10 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Anker: Anker is a borough located just outside the city walls of the City of Pilegron. It was initially developed to accommodate a small port on the Pilger River. While it features a mix of housing and small industries, it remains unconnected to the train network. Anker is notable for having some of the city's oldest, now-defunct factories, which were once instrumental in producing segments for the underground railway. The borough is also home to one of the wealthiest residents of Pilegron, Mr. O'brookes.,
- Blakefield: Blakefield, once a swampy area, has recently been transformed to accommodate settlements, industry, and a large railway yard. The area was previously traversed by a railway bridge known as Uxbridge. Currently, Blakefield boasts a significant amount of undeveloped land, indicating potential for industrial growth. Its location is somewhat secluded, as it is situated within a valley.,
- Uxbridge: Uxbridge is a district characterized by its historic brick bridge, a significant landmark that initially influenced its formation. The eastern side of the Pilger River is densely populated with small houses, largely controlled by Lloyds Investment Bank, which is currently restricting further development. In contrast, the western part remains mostly undeveloped, making it an intriguing area for future construction opportunities.,
- Ealing: Ealing is a centrally located, small district in the City of Pilegron, situated just outside the western city border. It features numerous small houses, a park, and some of the city's oldest homes that have been relocated here for preservation. Ealing is positioned along one of the main streets and boasts excellent connectivity with the tube.,
- Kensington: Kensington is a posh borough located in the city center, primarily inhabited by conservative and wealthy residents. It is known for its traditional, well-paying professions such as judges and doctors rather than for innovation. Originally home to sheep farms, it now features lavish houses inside and outside the old city walls. The Ealing Tower, a remnant of the fortifications, partially stands in Kensington. A notable feature is its rare and ancient disposal line, a relic of Pilegron's first inhabitants. The main thoroughfare is Kensington Lane, branching from Main Street. There are no metro or train stations, as the residents opposed their construction.
