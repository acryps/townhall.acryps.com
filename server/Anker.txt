i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Anker", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #20 in size, #20 closest to center, #17 in population, #23 in population density, #20 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Tower Hamlets: Tower Hamlets is a district situated just outside the central area of the City of Pilegron. It is characterized by its early industrial factories and residential buildings, including the city's oldest railway factory. The district neighbors two small areas known as Anchor and contains significant historic sites such as Mayfair, a notable restaurant where the city's expansion plans were made, and Manor House, once the residence of a duke.,
- Blakefield: Blakefield, once a swampy area, has recently been transformed to accommodate settlements, industry, and a large railway yard. The area was previously traversed by a railway bridge known as Uxbridge. Currently, Blakefield boasts a significant amount of undeveloped land, indicating potential for industrial growth. Its location is somewhat secluded, as it is situated within a valley.,
- Chelsea: Chelsea is an outer district in the City of Pilegron known for its expansive gardened houses. Although only a few houses have been constructed, all land has already been allocated. The area offers stunning lake views and has a single railway connection. Conceived as an experiment to gauge interest in suburban living, it has achieved mild success in attracting residents looking for larger homes with more land.,
- Regent: Regent is home to the presidential residence and features a prominent, expansive park.,
- Bourbaki: null,
- Hamstad: Hamstad is a small district known for its single historic defensive building, which remains as its primary feature. Once used for defense, this building now serves as a historical site, with no other developments or structures present in the area.,
- Kensington: Kensington is a posh borough located in the city center, primarily inhabited by conservative and wealthy residents. It is known for its traditional, well-paying professions such as judges and doctors rather than for innovation. Originally home to sheep farms, it now features lavish houses inside and outside the old city walls. The Ealing Tower, a remnant of the fortifications, partially stands in Kensington. A notable feature is its rare and ancient disposal line, a relic of Pilegron's first inhabitants. The main thoroughfare is Kensington Lane, branching from Main Street. There are no metro or train stations, as the residents opposed their construction.
