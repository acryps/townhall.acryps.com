i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Brunock", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #24 in size, #32 closest to center, #20 in population, #24 in population density, #38 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Enfield: Enfield, once an open field, now hosts significant urban development, including a prestigious university shared with Bexley. It features a large, well-known train station and the notable Rawie complex, which operates as a self-governed district.,
- Portbryn: Portbryn is a district known for its abundance of student housing, situated on a hill. It features a notable and undisrupted post station, and many university buildings. The area is served by a railway station on the university railway. Its name is derived from Port Prince Square, a historically significant site with an ancient, now inactive, portal to another dimension.,
- Ferrowfield: Ferrowfield is a crucial industrial hub in the City of Pilegron. Originally open plains known as Faoro Field, it transformed with the industrial movement building significant iron plants. The district was designed as a collaborative industrial zone, fostering shared resources among various industries. Ferrowfield houses the pivotal Union Station, born from a major freight station, which serves multiple railway companies and has become the heart of the public railway system. The cityâ€™s administrative activities are concentrated here, with key centers like Law House. Recently, Ferrowfield has expanded rapidly, becoming increasingly compact. Although Union Station is a vital city hub, it now primarily serves private railway companies.
