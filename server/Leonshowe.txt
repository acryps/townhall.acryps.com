i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Leonshowe", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #14 in size, #17 closest to center, #8 in population, #20 in population density, #8 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Edminton: Edminton is an industrial hub in the City of Pilegron. It features both a station and a tube station, serving as key transport links for its numerous factories. The borough is notably home to the infamous Rochester House.,
- Uxbridge: Uxbridge is a district characterized by its historic brick bridge, a significant landmark that initially influenced its formation. The eastern side of the Pilger River is densely populated with small houses, largely controlled by Lloyds Investment Bank, which is currently restricting further development. In contrast, the western part remains mostly undeveloped, making it an intriguing area for future construction opportunities.,
- Westminster: Westminster, a borough in the City of Pilegron, hosts the city's main church and lies next to the central Metier Street. It is noteworthy for its proximity to a park and the old city walls. Though sparsely populated on Spruce Street, it is famous for its historic shooting range where military officers and sport shooters have trained. Leon Street, a major thoroughfare, connects to Leonshowe from here. Westminster Train Station, developed under the "Each Borough Station Act", provides key transport links within the city.,
- City of Pilegron: The City of Pilegron's central borough is the heart of administration and home to prominent companies. Originating from a few houses along Main Street, it centers around Metier Hall, where congress meets. Metier Street, another key area, extends from Metier Hall. Despite the borough's central importance, the northern end remains undeveloped with no future plans. Residential presence is minimal, with historic buildings on Pachino and Halifax Street housing the few residents, as most buildings are occupied by company offices.,
- Origin: Origin is a historic district situated on a mountain that remains a park today, symbolizing where the City of Pilegron began. It features the Origin Tower, a former military structure that once safeguarded the city. The district also hosts essential buildings for newcomers and is home to the Origin Main Station, the city's central railway hub.,
- Portbryn: Portbryn is a district known for its abundance of student housing, situated on a hill. It features a notable and undisrupted post station, and many university buildings. The area is served by a railway station on the university railway. Its name is derived from Port Prince Square, a historically significant site with an ancient, now inactive, portal to another dimension.,
- Ferrowfield: Ferrowfield is a crucial industrial hub in the City of Pilegron. Originally open plains known as Faoro Field, it transformed with the industrial movement building significant iron plants. The district was designed as a collaborative industrial zone, fostering shared resources among various industries. Ferrowfield houses the pivotal Union Station, born from a major freight station, which serves multiple railway companies and has become the heart of the public railway system. The cityâ€™s administrative activities are concentrated here, with key centers like Law House. Recently, Ferrowfield has expanded rapidly, becoming increasingly compact. Although Union Station is a vital city hub, it now primarily serves private railway companies.,
- Rochester: Rochester, once a military district, has transformed into a prosperous borough characterized by extensive worker housing. It pioneered a housing system that enabled the rapid construction of affordable homes with decent living standards, attracting a significant influx of workers. This growth has been capitalized on through the development of a metro line connecting Rochester to nearby industrial zones, further boosting its wealth. Though the district continues to expand, some of the land remains undeveloped, with the foundational grid already in place. Rochester retains its military heritage with training grounds and a shooting range still active. Lush parks and broad, tree-lined roads enhance the living environment, while the historically significant Rochester Bridge has been replaced by a charming pedestrian walkway.
