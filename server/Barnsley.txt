i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Barnsley", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #5 in size, #43 closest to center, #7 in population, #26 in population density, #5 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Shepton: Shepton, once a small farming village known for its inexpensive trade, was the first to be absorbed by the expanding City of Pilegron. Now an integral part of the city, Shepton is notable for its significant railway station and the crucial law house where all legislation is enacted. Although it has only a few houses, its historical significance is immense, having been one of the initial targets of railway expansion and still retaining its charming old railway station.,
- Tilbury Hill: Tilbury Hill is home to the university's research station, specializing in height and high-altitude tests. Despite its prime location and plans to industrialize the area with tax incentives, no developments have occurred yet. The borough, situated atop a hill, is challenging to access aside from the main road that connects Barnsley and the city.,
- Hornaby: Hornaby is an industrial district in the City of Pilegron, known for its development of Metro stations. The area features a mix of row houses and numerous office spaces. A notable highlight is its large public park, which has been designated as a natural park for preservation.
