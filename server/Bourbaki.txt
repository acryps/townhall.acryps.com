i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Bourbaki", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #23 in size, #19 closest to center, #6 in population, #7 in population density, #7 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Anker: Anker is a borough located just outside the city walls of the City of Pilegron. It was initially developed to accommodate a small port on the Pilger River. While it features a mix of housing and small industries, it remains unconnected to the train network. Anker is notable for having some of the city's oldest, now-defunct factories, which were once instrumental in producing segments for the underground railway. The borough is also home to one of the wealthiest residents of Pilegron, Mr. O'brookes.,
- Regent: Regent is home to the presidential residence and features a prominent, expansive park.,
- Hamstad: Hamstad is a small district known for its single historic defensive building, which remains as its primary feature. Once used for defense, this building now serves as a historical site, with no other developments or structures present in the area.,
- Camden: Camden is the historical heart of the City of Pilegron, situated along the Pilger River. Known for its preserved historic charm, it features the notable Church of Camden upon the river. Unlike other inner boroughs, it remains largely unchanged, housing mainly residents who cherish its traditional character. The community's strong opposition to change has posed challenges for infrastructure development, such as introducing a Metro Station.,
- Northwark: Northwark is one of the oldest districts in the City of Pilegron, situated just north of the Pilger River. Historically, its gate served as a guard against intruders. The district is known for its intriguing architecture, featuring unique houses alongside attractions such as a bear park and a fish tank. It is strategically located on the main street connecting Mebankment with Bourbaki, making it a notable area within the city.,
- Harrow: Harrow is an industrial district in the City of Pilegron, characterized by its significant factory presence and recent developments in the metro system. It has undergone substantial change with the introduction of the new Harrow Hill railway station, replacing much of the old industrial yard area. Though primarily industrial, it includes some residential housing. Situated on the city's main road, Harrow is appealing for property development. Historically, it housed some of the city's earliest residences, although only two remain after the recent accidental destruction of one.,
- Harrow Hill: Harrow Hill is home to the prominent new central railway station of a private railway company. The area's transformation involved flattening the hill using challenging excavation techniques. Currently, Harrow Hill comprises primarily the railway station, a graveyard, and part of the Duke of Yorkshire's estate. Its strategic location on the city's main road influenced the railway company's decision to establish their station here.
