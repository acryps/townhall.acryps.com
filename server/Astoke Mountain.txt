i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Astoke Mountain", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #28 in size, #42 closest to center, #33 in population, #33 in population density, #34 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Kittenhill: Kittenhill is an industrial district, once home to a hill filled with children and kittens, but now transformed to accommodate the Mekle Iron Company's iron farm. It features numerous railways leading out of Union Station, passing through the area. Key industries in Kittenhill include sheep herding and wool production, a shear manufacturing business, and a bed-making company. The district also hosts the Railway Labs Company with a testing ring for new railway equipment, although recent developments have seen the public railways acquire this company, with no inventions having been released yet.,
- Pilebrook: Pilebrook is the borough where the Pilger River meets the sea. It features two large railway stations, intended to support shipping activities that were never realized due to the railways eliminating the need for a port. This has left Pilebrook less developed compared to other areas in the City of Pilegron. Additionally, there is potential for future development given the available free land.,
- Astokeshire: Astokeshire is the primary estate of the Duke of Astokeshire, a significant landowner in the region. The Duke's large manor is situated on a mountain within Astokeshire, which is currently entirely forested. The district lacks any residential buildings but features a train bridge connecting it to Sheenford.
