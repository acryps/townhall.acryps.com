i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Blacksmith", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #46 in size, #7 closest to center, #16 in population, #1 in population density, #30 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Camden: Camden is the historical heart of the City of Pilegron, situated along the Pilger River. Known for its preserved historic charm, it features the notable Church of Camden upon the river. Unlike other inner boroughs, it remains largely unchanged, housing mainly residents who cherish its traditional character. The community's strong opposition to change has posed challenges for infrastructure development, such as introducing a Metro Station.,
- Kensington: Kensington is a posh borough located in the city center, primarily inhabited by conservative and wealthy residents. It is known for its traditional, well-paying professions such as judges and doctors rather than for innovation. Originally home to sheep farms, it now features lavish houses inside and outside the old city walls. The Ealing Tower, a remnant of the fortifications, partially stands in Kensington. A notable feature is its rare and ancient disposal line, a relic of Pilegron's first inhabitants. The main thoroughfare is Kensington Lane, branching from Main Street. There are no metro or train stations, as the residents opposed their construction.,
- Northwark: Northwark is one of the oldest districts in the City of Pilegron, situated just north of the Pilger River. Historically, its gate served as a guard against intruders. The district is known for its intriguing architecture, featuring unique houses alongside attractions such as a bear park and a fish tank. It is strategically located on the main street connecting Mebankment with Bourbaki, making it a notable area within the city.,
- Paddington: Paddington is a compact district in the City of Pilegron, known for its concentration of architecture firms. Despite its small size, it features a minor railway and station. The district is notable for its infamous customs office and is characterized by its charming, fully developed landscape, filled with historically significant houses.,
- New Republic: New Republic is a central district located just north of the city proper in the City of Pilegron. Historically, it was home to the Congress building, which has since been demolished. The district's name, New Republic, reflects its transformation into a socially oriented housing area following the demolition. Despite its central location, it is one of the poorest neighborhoods due to the deterioration of its social housing over the years. The area is densely built, featuring dirt roads, and is notably marked by Congress Gate, a remnant of the old Congress building. The few available plots have been acquired by an investment company.,
- City of Pilegron: The City of Pilegron's central borough is the heart of administration and home to prominent companies. Originating from a few houses along Main Street, it centers around Metier Hall, where congress meets. Metier Street, another key area, extends from Metier Hall. Despite the borough's central importance, the northern end remains undeveloped with no future plans. Residential presence is minimal, with historic buildings on Pachino and Halifax Street housing the few residents, as most buildings are occupied by company offices.
