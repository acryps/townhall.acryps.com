i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Kittenhill", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #13 in size, #37 closest to center, #43 in population, #43 in population density, #3 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Ferrowfield: Ferrowfield is a crucial industrial hub in the City of Pilegron. Originally open plains known as Faoro Field, it transformed with the industrial movement building significant iron plants. The district was designed as a collaborative industrial zone, fostering shared resources among various industries. Ferrowfield houses the pivotal Union Station, born from a major freight station, which serves multiple railway companies and has become the heart of the public railway system. The cityâ€™s administrative activities are concentrated here, with key centers like Law House. Recently, Ferrowfield has expanded rapidly, becoming increasingly compact. Although Union Station is a vital city hub, it now primarily serves private railway companies.,
- Rochester: Rochester, once a military district, has transformed into a prosperous borough characterized by extensive worker housing. It pioneered a housing system that enabled the rapid construction of affordable homes with decent living standards, attracting a significant influx of workers. This growth has been capitalized on through the development of a metro line connecting Rochester to nearby industrial zones, further boosting its wealth. Though the district continues to expand, some of the land remains undeveloped, with the foundational grid already in place. Rochester retains its military heritage with training grounds and a shooting range still active. Lush parks and broad, tree-lined roads enhance the living environment, while the historically significant Rochester Bridge has been replaced by a charming pedestrian walkway.,
- Pilebrook: Pilebrook is the borough where the Pilger River meets the sea. It features two large railway stations, intended to support shipping activities that were never realized due to the railways eliminating the need for a port. This has left Pilebrook less developed compared to other areas in the City of Pilegron. Additionally, there is potential for future development given the available free land.,
- Astoke Mountain: Astoke Mountain was originally owned by the Duke of Astokeshire, who has a residence on a nearby mountain. Ownership of Astoke Mountain has been transferred to the City of Pilegron in exchange for other land in Astokeshire. Currently, there are no inhabitants on Astoke Mountain, but two state railway tunnels run through it.,
- Astokeshire: Astokeshire is the primary estate of the Duke of Astokeshire, a significant landowner in the region. The Duke's large manor is situated on a mountain within Astokeshire, which is currently entirely forested. The district lacks any residential buildings but features a train bridge connecting it to Sheenford.
