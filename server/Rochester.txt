i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Rochester", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #1 in size, #39 closest to center, #1 in population, #3 in population density, #1 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Leonshowe: Leonshowe, a central district in the City of Pilegron, holds historical significance as it originated from the Duke of Leon's house built on its mountainous terrain. It later became home to the Metro factory and early systematic housing. The district features an incomplete station and is marked for the Science City University expansion, though only a single university building exists so far. Despite its central location, much of Leonshowe remains underdeveloped, with significant land owned by the university or the Duke of Leonshowe.,
- Ferrowfield: Ferrowfield is a crucial industrial hub in the City of Pilegron. Originally open plains known as Faoro Field, it transformed with the industrial movement building significant iron plants. The district was designed as a collaborative industrial zone, fostering shared resources among various industries. Ferrowfield houses the pivotal Union Station, born from a major freight station, which serves multiple railway companies and has become the heart of the public railway system. The cityâ€™s administrative activities are concentrated here, with key centers like Law House. Recently, Ferrowfield has expanded rapidly, becoming increasingly compact. Although Union Station is a vital city hub, it now primarily serves private railway companies.,
- Kittenhill: Kittenhill is an industrial district, once home to a hill filled with children and kittens, but now transformed to accommodate the Mekle Iron Company's iron farm. It features numerous railways leading out of Union Station, passing through the area. Key industries in Kittenhill include sheep herding and wool production, a shear manufacturing business, and a bed-making company. The district also hosts the Railway Labs Company with a testing ring for new railway equipment, although recent developments have seen the public railways acquire this company, with no inventions having been released yet.,
- Pilebrook: Pilebrook is the borough where the Pilger River meets the sea. It features two large railway stations, intended to support shipping activities that were never realized due to the railways eliminating the need for a port. This has left Pilebrook less developed compared to other areas in the City of Pilegron. Additionally, there is potential for future development given the available free land.,
- Weir: Weir is an outer district characterized by extensive worker housing, designed following the Rochester model. It features the significant Weir Dam, a prominent structure that separates the district from the main city area.,
- Welatunelton: Welatunelton is an artistic district known for its historical transformation from once swampy lands to a hub of industry. It primarily houses railway yards, service workshops, and factories of the Metro company. An intriguing historical fact about Welatunelton is that it once featured a tunnel used to bring in foreign workers from outside the city. The district is undergoing rapid changes, suggesting a shift in its character and possibly its role within the City of Pilegron.,
- Edminton: Edminton is an industrial hub in the City of Pilegron. It features both a station and a tube station, serving as key transport links for its numerous factories. The borough is notably home to the infamous Rochester House.
