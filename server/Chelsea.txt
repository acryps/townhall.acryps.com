i am writing descriptions of boroughs in my fictional city. i have recorded the descriptions using text to speech software, which might have introduced some issues. the text to speech software made a lot of issues, so no matter what, only call this district "Chelsea", even if the following text has the name written wrong. we are in 1890 europe, a bit like london. but beware, just because some of the names might sound familiar, they must not represent what has been built in real life. some general info about this district, which might help you. there are 47 boroughs in total: #6 in size, #35 closest to center, #37 in population, #37 in population density, #39 in work offering. write about 3 paragraphs. do not just repeat the rankings as text, use it to form a pretty text. do not say anything about that this is a fictional city, or london or europe. the city is called "City of Pilegron". the river is called "Pilger River". there are no countries yet, nor continents. do not invent stuff only use the data i provided.

also to consider are the boroughs neibors. here a list and a short description of them: 
- Anker: Anker is a borough located just outside the city walls of the City of Pilegron. It was initially developed to accommodate a small port on the Pilger River. While it features a mix of housing and small industries, it remains unconnected to the train network. Anker is notable for having some of the city's oldest, now-defunct factories, which were once instrumental in producing segments for the underground railway. The borough is also home to one of the wealthiest residents of Pilegron, Mr. O'brookes.,
- Regent: Regent is home to the presidential residence and features a prominent, expansive park.,
- Harrow Hill: Harrow Hill is home to the prominent new central railway station of a private railway company. The area's transformation involved flattening the hill using challenging excavation techniques. Currently, Harrow Hill comprises primarily the railway station, a graveyard, and part of the Duke of Yorkshire's estate. Its strategic location on the city's main road influenced the railway company's decision to establish their station here.
